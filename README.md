# ðŸ“š Welcome!

Welcome to the site, where you will find every trick/technique/etc. I have learnt during CTFs, work researching, etc.\
\
The goal of this project is to make an overview of everything that I have learned when it comes to performing an cyber threat investigation. 
The first part of this book will be about intelligence, it there to help us bind all the difference sources of information that we have together into an cohesive and structured analysis of the information that we used to perform attribution on the threat actor. 

The next part will be forensics where I will try to cover as many as possible difference possible data source in difference devices. The goal of that section is to give an investigation enough information to know enough have context around the information that gather and what question they can ask. 

Because it limited how much information you can gather from your own environment or incident. you must at some point start to look into difference source this is where OSINT comes into the picture, it allow you to take the information you collected in the forensics phase and ask additional question that you could not ask else where.   


If you do not what to read about the difference collection sources and just want an quick overview I will point you to my mindmap: [https:\\paradoxxs.github.io\mindmap](https://paradoxxs.github.io/mindmap/)
