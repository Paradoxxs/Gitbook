## HTTP server logs

Store all types of logs for an Apache HTTP server, including access logs and error logs. The error_log file contains all bad requests received by the http server. These mistakes incorporate memory issues and other framework-related blunders. The access_log contains a record of all solicitations received via HTTP.
