Attribution is the processes trying to identify persons behind threat groups. This is critical step if the goal is to do prosecution.\
The process of attribution requires analysis of data over a long period of time. You might have to wait for the threat group to make an mistake that could lead to information which is the final pieces of the puzzle to perform true attribution of the threat group.  

There exists four method of attribution.

* Adversary admission
* Leaks
* Direct access
* Intrusion analysis

Adversary admission is when the people admins they did the intrusions, and take credit for the action.\
Remember they might be lying.

Leaks is when threat have released of information, Edward Snowden is an good example of this. This does not mean that the data is 100% true. There is a high probability there is misinformation in between the leak.

Direct access, you have access to either the systems or direct interacts with the threat in classic HUMINT operation.\
It could be an counter intelligence operation or in case of criminal taking credit for other people work. 

The final is intrusion analysis, analysis of multiple intrusion that is grouped together. That can be linked to an activity group. The final stage is threat group. This method is very affected by our field of view and biases on how the data is interpreted. 

Any of these method is not enough to make true attribution as they are all flawed in some way. This is why we need to use at least two of the method described here.
