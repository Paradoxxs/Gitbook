Intelligence analysis is performed when you do not have all the facts.\
An assessment is performed, on the likelihood that a given hypothesis can be rejected or not.\
What set intelligence analysis apart from forensics, is that intelligence is by it nature not testable.\
You are not able to pickup the phone and call the threat actor and verify.

# Analysis

Analysis is detailed examination of element, by breaking something down into its parts to better understand how it operate.\
This is what we do with intrusion. We try to deconstruct it down to understand the action of an threat group.

The other part of analysis is synthesis of information.\
Taking the different pieces of information and putting them together to get an better picture of the threat group.
an example could be multiple intrusions put together to find overlapping pieces of information.\
Which we use to perform threat profiling.


## Scientific process

Analysis should always use the scientific process.\
You do not analysis all the information and determine what questions can be answered based on it.

Stage of scientific process:
1. Start by first creating an clearly defined hypotheses.
2. Create an roadmap what information you need and how you will analysis the information.
3. Conduct information gathering
4. Analyses


## Analytic judgement 

The core product of the analysis is the judgement or assessment based on the information that available to them.\
It important that they do not make an judgement based on others analysis. This is because two analysis will not have the same information available to them.\ 
The strength of the judgment so be written out clearly. Ensuring the reader understand the likelihood of the assessment being true.\
This is way we have estimative language.


## Type of analysis

There are many type of analysis and have their own way of working with information.

### Data-driven

Accuracy is based on the dataset completeness, logical driven.
request good dataset and straightforward problems.

### Conceptually driven

Numerous unknowns variables and relationship.
Accuracy is driven by mental models and feedback over time

### Mosaic theory

Information comes together to tell the right story, heavily based on the analyst interpretation of the information

### Visual

Display the information in an visual way to tell the story of the information.


## Mental models

Mental models are frame of reference or mindsets that people have adopted. That are formed from experience.
It helps people to work with vast amount of data.\
As it allows the people to make quick work of information because it something they have seen before, One of the downfall of mental models is analyst might make assumption about the data and not identify key information.

## Structured analysis

### Competing hypotheses&#x20;

Process whereby you identify a set of hypotheses, and systematically evaluate data that is consistent or inconsistent with each hypothesis. In the end reject the hypotheses that have too much inconsistent data.

Steps

1. Identify all potential hypotheses
2. List all evidence and arguments
3. Use the matrix to apply evidence to the hypotheses
4. Review and find gaps and any needs for evidence
5. Determine feasibility of hypotheses
6. How would the hypotheses be impacted if certain key evidence were wrong
7. Determine the best hypotheses

### Matrix

\+ : Consistence with evidence\
\- : Inconsistence with evidence

| Evidence                                              | Hacker stealing data | Insider selling information |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Information on the dark web                           | +                    | -                           |
| Quotes and consistently beaten on price               | +                    | +                           |
| High amount of network traffic to unknown destination | +                    | -                           |
