Structured analysis

### Competing hypotheses&#x20;

Process whereby you identify a set of hypothese, and systematically evaluate data that is consistent or inconsistent with each hypothesis. In the end reject the hypothese that have too much incosistent data.

Steps

1. Identify all potential hypotheses
2. List all evidence and arguments
3. Use the matrix to apply evidence to the hypotheses
4. Review and find gaps and any needs for evidence
5. Determine feasibility of hypotheses
6. How would the hypotheses be impated if certain key evidence were wrong
7. Determine the best hypotheses

#### Matrix

\+ : Consistence with evidence\
\- : Inconsistence with evidence

| Evidence                                              | Hacker stealing data | Insider selling information |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Information on the dark web                           | +                    | -                           |
| Quotes and consistently beaten on price               | +                    | +                           |
| High amount of network traffic to unknown destination | +                    | -                           |
