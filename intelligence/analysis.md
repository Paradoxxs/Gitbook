# Analysis

Analysis is detailed examination of element, by breaking something down into its parts to better understand how it operate.

This is what we do with incident and threat actors, we try to deconstruct it down to understand how they operate.

The other part we do is synthesis of information by taking different pieces of information and putting when together to get an better picture of the actor.
an example could be multiple intrusions we put together to find overlapping pieces of information.


## Scientific process

When doing analysis always use the scientific process. You do not analysis all the information and determine what questions can be answered based on it.

1. Start by first creating an clearly defined hypotheses.
2. Create an roadmap what information you need and how you will analysis the information.
3. Conduct information gathering
4. Analyse


## Analysis judgement
The core product of the analysis is to make an judgement based on the information that available to them, and not based on other analysis.
If there there is not enough information to make a strong judgment, the analysis could write they have a **Low to medium confidence in the assessment**

## Type of analysis

There are many type of analysis and have their own way of working with information.

### Data-driven

Accuracy is based on the dataset completeness, logical driven.
request good dataset and straightforward problems.

### Conceptually driven

Numerous unknowns variables and relationship.
Accuracy is driven by mental models and feedback over time

### Mosaic theory

Information comes together to tell the right story, heavily based on the analyst interpretation of the information

### Visual

Display the information in an visual way to tell the story of the information.


## Mental models

Mental models are frame of reference or mindsets that people have adopted. That are formed from experience.
It helps people to work with vast amount of information. It allows the analysis to make quick work of information because it something they have seen many times before, One of the downfall of mental models is analyst might make assumption about the data and not identify key information.

## Structured analysis

### Competing hypotheses&#x20;

Process whereby you identify a set of hypothese, and systematically evaluate data that is consistent or inconsistent with each hypothesis. In the end reject the hypothese that have too much incosistent data.

Steps

1. Identify all potential hypotheses
2. List all evidence and arguments
3. Use the matrix to apply evidence to the hypotheses
4. Review and find gaps and any needs for evidence
5. Determine feasibility of hypotheses
6. How would the hypotheses be impated if certain key evidence were wrong
7. Determine the best hypotheses

#### Matrix

\+ : Consistence with evidence\
\- : Inconsistence with evidence

| Evidence                                              | Hacker stealing data | Insider selling information |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Information on the dark web                           | +                    | -                           |
| Quotes and consistently beaten on price               | +                    | +                           |
| High amount of network traffic to unknown destination | +                    | -                           |
