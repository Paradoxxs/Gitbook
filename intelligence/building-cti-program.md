---
When senior management have green lit the CTI program.\
Here are some of the key element one should have set in place when setting up an CTI program inside an organization.\
Before you event start on the road to building an CTI program, we have to find out if the organization is ready.

Some fundamental question to ask before starting the program. 
* Do you have security function at the organization
* Are there network visibility in place
* Are there multiple stakeholders to support
* Do you have the budget

## Requirement creation

* Identify and consult key stakeholders
* Map analyst workflows and data processes
* Determine what inputs and outputs are  needed
* Prioritize requirements (MoSCoW)
  * Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Wish (buy) or Will not have at this time (build)

## Question to ask

* What are your requirements ?
* Who are the audiences?
* How do the consumer wants to consume the information?
  
Maybe the most important question to ask the CTI team. Based on the requirement set forth do you need to generate intelligence or is consumption of intelligence enough?

## Competencies of CTI team

To have an complete CTI program. You need a wide array of skills.\
Which no single person can fill all the competencies. which is why it important to have a diverge team of people.\
The more diverge the team is the better, this is because it also help the team overcome their bias.
