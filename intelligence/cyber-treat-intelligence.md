# Cyber treat intelligence

## Threat hunting

Is the active process of trying to find signs of compromise.

### Intel to threat hunting and incident response

1. Threat model
   * Select a threat and its tactics techniques and procedures (TTP)
2. Create a hypothesis
   * Create a testable statement related to how the threat TTP would impact your organisation
3. Overlay the tradecraft and your CMF
   * Map the hypothesis to the CMF to identify what needed to be tested
4. Hunting
   * Hunt aginst the hypothesis and CMF
5. Learn
   * Identify gaps and opportunities of improvement
   * Create playbooks for future investigation against the TTP in your environment

## The Rule of 2

Simply way for campaign creation is applying the diamond model looking for overlaps between two vertices in intrusions or campaigns.

## Pyramid of pain

The higher up in the pyramid of pain, the more difficult will it will for the threat actor to change their behaviour.

### Threat feeds

Before acquiring an threat feed you need to understand why you need it, An good way to start with threat feed is using open source like DShield, if you do not know how to handle it, you are not ready for the next level. One of the key question to ask about threat feed is the data source of the feed.
