# Frameworks

Benefits of using an framework

Allow one to structure once thinking on a specific topic, ensuring the important parts are covered. It also allow for an common language to communicate internally and externaly regarding the threat.

### Cyber kill chain

Based on military concept of the kill chain Like a chain if one of the link break the whole attack fails.

Describes an adversary deploys a capability via infrastructure against a victim Developed to be complementary to the cyberthreat kill chain For every intrusion event there exists an adversary taking a step towards an intended goal by using a capability over infrastructure against a victim to produce a result

#### Adversary

Threat / Operator

One of the main problem that is seen a lot is the tracking of malware authors instead of Threat / operator

#### Infrastructure

What system, network, e.g are they using to deliver their capabilities

#### Victim

It important to disquietly between victim and target

### Capability/ Tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP)

What tools, techniques, etc. do they use to perm their action

#### Axioms

1. In every intrusion event an adversary takes a step towards an intended goal by using a capability over infrastructure against a victim to produce a result.
2. There exists a set of adversaries which seek to compromise computer systems or networks to further their intent and satisfy their needs.
3. Every system, and by extension every victim asset, has vulnerabilities and exposures
4. Every malicious activity contains two or more phases which must be successfully executed in succession to achieve the desired result.
5. Every intrusion event requires one or more external resources to be satisfied prior to success.
6. A relationship always exists between the Adversary and their Victim(s) even if distant, fleeting, or indirect.
7. There exists a subset of the set of adversaries which have the motivation, resources, and capabilities to sustain malicious effects for a significant length of time against one or more victims while resisting mitigation efforts.

### Mitre attack

Track the different tactic that can be used in an attack including the tactic the different threat group utilize.
