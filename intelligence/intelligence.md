# Intelligence



The goal of threat intelligence is to gather, evaluate and analysis data related to an threat actor.\
with the goain to better insight to the tactic technique and procedure (TTP) to make better decisions on how to mitigate risk to organization.



### Intelligence level

Tactical

* Speific action that can be taken to defend the organisation.

Operational

* Bridges tactical and strategic, by assessing the organization operating enviroment to identify potential risk.

Strategic

* Define the objectives and guidance on what threat should be mitigated and the security posture of the organization.



## Intelligence process lifecycle

### Direction

Understanding the needs of the audience, and define intelligence requirements to address the threat

What assets need to be protected?

### Collection

Gathering of data from different source.

Data in a vacuum, without context, is difficult to interpret and understand, which is why we have multiple sources of data that can be correlated together to create intelligence, by enriching data and providing value by passing the information to the different stakeholders.

### Processing

Data is transformed into a understandable format.

### Analysis

Assessment of the treat capability and vulnerability, based on the data collected.

### Dissemination

Distrubution of the intelligence report

### Feedback

Feedback loop for improving the process.





## Intelligence classification

#### Unknown-unknown

Unaware of the existence of a threat

#### Known-unlnown

The threat is known but not understood

#### Known-known

We both know and understand the threat, and resource to put in place to mitigate them.



### Collection

### Collection management framework

Datasheet that explain the source of informations, and what we can expect from them.

####

### Processing

#### Rosetta stone

Translation naming schema what the different vendors calls malware, threat actors, etc.. Very helpful to understand different threat reports.

### Analysis

#### Bias

Everyone has bias, and it important as an analyst to be aware of your own bias, allowing you to counter your biases.

Which is why the CTI team, need to be compromised of multiple different type of people to combat biases.

Cognitive bias [24 Cognitive Biases stuffing up your thinking](https://yourbias.is/)

#### Structured analytic techniques (SAT)

* Decision matrix
* Decision trees



#### Data pivoting / Analytic leaps

1. Start with single indicator
2. Pivot through each data source and add relevant data points
3. Validate, ensure links contain context and ensure the links are meaningful
4. Identify the relevant indicators
5. Be aware of the Kevin bacon effect
   * It takes 6 hops/pivoting to know anyone in the world.

### Dissemination

#### Traffic light protocol (TLP)

Defined widely recognized threat intel protection level and who it can be shared with.&#x20;

#### Estimative language

Because the meaning of words like likely, might, etc. is highly subjectively, which is why it is important to have an agreed-upon language of the estimate, like a scale

Another good idea is to add percentages to make the meaning clear. e.g. might happen (70%)
