description: Mapping out the infrastructure.
---

Many cyber crime require some kind of network infrastructure to host the payload.\
This could be a phishing page, C2, etc.\
The goal of the chapter is to help you map out the infrastructure of the adversary.  


# IP address

Internet protocol (IP) purpose is to handle transmissions of packets between network end point, Host identify with a unique address. Using the OSI layer 3.

IP is a unique number that that reference to a computer.
IPv4 is a 32-bit limit to 4.294.967.296, because of this limit NAT have been developed to allowing more computers on the internet.
IPv6 is a 128-bit where the limit is 3.4 x 10â†‘34

When it comes to analysis IP addresses. I quickly go to [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) because it can identify a lot of information. If you prefer to use cli they also have they option [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli).


Another useful service is [ipinfodb](https://www.ipinfodb.com/) which also tries to geolocate IP addresses and perform service fingerprinting.
## WhoIs

IP are registered like domains and using the **WhoIs** command will allow you to view the current WhoIs information.

[domainiq](https://www.domainiq.com/)

[ViewDNS](https://viewdns.info/whois/)

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

Does everything from identifying location, VPN, Service, domains and etc.

## Reverse domain names lookup
Multiple domain names can be hosted on a single IP address, using reverse DNS lookup allow you to identify every domain hosted on the IP.

[View DNS Reverse IP](https://viewdns.info/reverseip/)

Bing search engine can also be used to identify domains hosted on a IP address. Using the query parameter **IP:{ip address}**.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)

Does a everything from identifying location, VPN, Service, domains and etc.

[bing.com/search?q=ip%3a+204.93.177.100](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ip%3a+204.93.177.100)

Will only identify one domain, if multiple domain are hosted on the same IP use the tools above.

````cmd
nslookup {ip address}
````

## IP location
It possible to cross-locate an IP address.
Most often when searching for IP location it the providers location that is provided.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

[ipinfodb](https://www.ipinfodb.com/)

[Geo-Recon tool](https://github.com/radioactivetobi/geo-recon)

[db-ip](https://db-ip.com/)

[iplocation](https://www.iplocation.net/)

[maxmind geoip](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en)

Database over IP addresses geolocation.

## IP classification

Lookup up IP address that is involved in fraud and scams.

[Scamalytics](https://scamalytics.com/ip)

Will try to score IP address based on their risk.

[getipintel](https://getipintel.net/)

Using mathematical and computing techniques to identify is the IP is used as VPN or TOR node. Because the result is normalized it range is from 0 to 1. There 1 indicates it a VPN or TOR node.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

## Ports

Every service that is hosted on a IP address need it own port, one of the most common ports are HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443). There might be additional ports available.

## Censys

[Censys](https://search.censys.io/)

Will allow you to search on IP addresses providing you with what ports are open on the individual ports.

## Shodan

[Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) is another option which scans the internet looking devices and try to fingerprint the service is running on the port. When it comes to IP address we can use it to identify the service and version that are running on the IP.


## Namp

-WIP- should this be part of the book?

Nmap is a Port Scanner tool, used to discovery open ports, services version and OS fingerprinting

Nmap scripting engine allows for [[Vulnerability Scanning]] for the most common Vulnerability  
Scanning of [[IPv6]] is support  but limited to a single address.
	- OS fingerprinting, NSE scripts, SYN or connect scans and ping scan.

### Script
--script
`--script==vuln`  activate all script in vuln category
-   `safe`:- Won't affect the target
-   `intrusive`:- Not safe: likely to affect the target  

-   `vuln`:- Scan for vulnerabilities
-   `exploit`:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
-   `auth`:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
-   `brute`:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
-   `discovery`:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).
-

https://nmap.org/nsedoc/


## Torrenting

Identify what illegal material that have by download on a specific IP address.

[I know what you download](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/)


## TOR nodes

The onion router relay nodes used to hide people identify.

[Tor porject metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html)

Will tell you if an specific IP address was used as a TOR relay.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)

Does everything from identifying location, VPN, Service, domains and etc.





# Domain

Domains are away to translate an IP-address to something more rememberable.
You have to register your domain with an internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (ICANN).

## Whois

When domain names are registered with ICANN data about who registered it is submitted.
User can make their data private to hide it from the public.
This data can also be false, old, wrong, etc. because there no enforcement of the data provided have to be valid.

The easiest way to view WhoIs information is using the **whois** command on Linux.
other wise site such as [viewdns.info/whois](http://www.viewdns.info/whois).

Because the information can change overtime, which is why historical data lookup could be used to identify a person.

**Historical Whois**:

[whoisology](https://whoisology.com/)

[whoxy](https://www.whoxy.com/)

[domainiq](https://www.domainiq.com/)

Have historical Whois information, it will also try to identify other sites owned by the same person, It does comes with an price.

**Reverse Whois**

It possible to perform reverse lookup on the registrant name or email that was used.

[ViewDNS reverse WhoIs](https://viewdns.info/reversewhois)

## Hosting

Domains are linked to an IP address. To identify the IP address it point to at the current moment you can use the **nslookup** command, but this will only gain you the current IP address it pointing to. Which is why looking at historical IP information can be used to gain useful information.

Historical domain IP addresses:

[Viewdns iphistory](https://viewdns.info/iphistory/)

[PassiveDNS](https://passivedns.mnemonic.no/)

## DNS

Domain name service are how domain names are translated to IP addresses and back.
It common for multiple domains to be tied to a single IP address, with DNS queries we can find those domains. An domain records contains multiple fields of data that can give us insight.



[Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/) is another option which scans the internet looking devices and try to fingerprint the service is running on the port. It allow you to setup an alerting based on domain.\
it also possible search on organization allowing you identify what services they have running on the internet they might have forgotten.\

I recommend you buy the membership as it allow you to perform additional query and increase the API request you have. The normal price is $50 but it sometimes on sale for just $5.

## Automation 

## TheHarvester

[TheHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) is an information gathering tool that utilizes OSINT sources to gather information about the target domain, and retrieve information such as hostnames, IP addresses, employees (and their positions), email addresses, and much more.\
It integrate with multiple sources together information from.

|Switch|description|
|---|---|
|-d|domain|
|-l|limit|
|-b|source|

Running an basic scan
````
./theHarvester.py -d domain.tld -l 100 -b all
````




# Website

Most often are domain related to an website or other kinds of services.
Websites will also be discussing in this section of the what kind of information can be retrieved from them.

## Domain analytics

In order to track user information when visiting the site. A key is loaded onto the site. That tells the browser to collect data and send it to google. This can be used to find other sites that share the same analytics id.

It common it you own multiple sites to use the same analytic ID to track them all.
This allow us to perform reverse search and pivot from one site to the other sites that also owned by the same user

[Analzeid](https://analyzeid.com/) perform cross-reference of multiple of attributes, like IP, analyst id, etc. To identify other website owned by the same person.

[Spy On Web](https://spyonweb.com/) Is one of the tool that will search an domain name and identify multiple sources of information and tries to cross-reference website that have multiple of the same attributes.
This allow you to identify that possible owned by the same person.

[Domainiq reverse analytics](https://www.domainiq.com/reverse_analytics)
will also perform reverse search on google analytics ID.

[Hacker target reverse analytics search](https://hackertarget.com/reverse-analytics-search/)
Is unique because it also have historical analytics ID.

## SSL certificates

It common for website to have an SSL certificate that allow for secure connection through the HTTPS protocol.

[crt.sh](https://crt.sh)
Identify historical certificates this can allow you to identify other domains that have been registered and with who they where registered with. Where it possible to ask the register for information on the person who register the domain.

[Censys.io](https://search.censys.io/)
Allow you to search on different attribute of certificates, allowing you to pivot on reuse of certificate attribute.
One usecase is to search for certificate which contains an specific name.

The good thing about Censys is that it provided in real-time, ensuring that the data is always up to date.

## Robots.txt

Found at the root of the website, it there to instructions the search engines crawler which webpages should not be index by the search engine.

**e.g. http://www.cnn.com/robots.txt**

This file can help us identify folders of the website like beta sites, websites under development, etc. Which we can possible use to identify additional information.

## backlink

Identify website that link to the target domain. [Host.io](https://host.io) will identify sites that link to the domain

## Redirects

Website can send http code 301 or 302 which tells the browser that the material you are looking for is at a new location. [Host.io](https://host.io) can also help you identify these.

## Monitoring

You might be interested in if an website changes it appears over time. This is where [Visualping.io](https://visualping.io/) can help you monitor websites and notify you if there are any changes to the site.

## Web archive


Record websites in order to preserve websites, allowing one to look back in time to see how the internet have changed over time.

[archive.org wayback machine](https://archive.org/)

[archive.ph](https://archive.ph/)


## Technology

This section is about identify the technology that are used to built the website.
The majority of moden website run on content management system (CMS). The information can be used to identify lingering files that can allow one to discover of information. 

Every website or service is built upon an technology, This is where [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) comes into play, it will try to identify the technology used on the site.

[blacklight privacy inspector](https://themarkup.org/) will look into the website and notify of privacy invasive activity.

When you visit an website you might have notices an icon in the tab bar. This is called an favicon. you are able to find other site which have the same favicon to identify other sites.
Before you start you have you calculate the hash value of the icon this is done with [faviconhash](https://faviconhash.com/).
The next step is to query the hash value on [shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io) using the query **http.favicon.hash:{hash}**

## Web exploration

Detection of security flaws or forgotten pages, etc. 

### Sn1per
[Sn1per](https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per) automate recon tool that can be used to perform attack surface discovery, vulnerability scanning.

### Wig
[Wig](https://github.com/jekyc/wig) CMS identification tool.

python3 wig.py example.com
````


Scan all plugin with know vulnerabilities
````
wpscan --url example.com -e vp --plugins-detection mixed --api-token YOUR_TOKEN
````

### WPscan
[WPscan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan) Wordpress security scanning tool. Wordpress is one of the most common CMS platform to build you website on. One of the reason it pick is because it easy to setup and there are vast amount of plugins that can help you perform specific tasks.
The problem is then at the security of these plugins is not the greatest and can add vulnerabilities to the site.
What WPscan does it tries to identify what plugins and the version that is running on the site. And uses the WordPress vunerability database to identify if there are any vulnerabilities in the plugins, Wordpress version, site configuration.

default scan
````
wpscan --url example.tld
````

### Zep attack proxy (ZAP)

[ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) is a GUI web application security testing tool, created by OWASP.
It allow you to automatic scans websites for common vulnerabilities.

### Nikto2

[Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) Is a web vulnerabilities scanner which checks for common CVE and get general information about the web server.


*Usage:*
|Command|Description|

|Nikto -h ip -p port,port2| scan ip on port(s)|++
|Nikto -h -maxtime| Max scan time|
|Nikto -h-no404| skip 404|
|-ssl| force ssl|
|-nossl| skip ssl|
|-output filename| output to a file|

## Directory, subdomain & other automated hunting

This section is about finding hidden information within websites. 

You will at some point be trying identifying additional information from an website one way to hit goal is done by identifying hidden or forgotten directory, subdomains.

One of the simplest way is to use an wordlist of common directory or subdomains. 
The other options is brute-forcing and crawling the site.
Subdomains are used to organize different sections of an website. There is no limits to the amount of subdomains you can have. There are tools can be used to perform dictionary attack against an site to identify subdomains.

### Censys subdomain finder

[Censys subdomian finder](https://github.com/christophetd/censys-subdomain-finder) is a tool for enumerate subdoamin using the censys certification logs. The tool return any subdomain that have issued a SSL certificate by an public CA.

### Gobuster

[Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) web brute-forcing tool for directory, subdomains, etc.

Iterater over an wordlist to check if directory is available on the website.
```
gobuster dir -w {wordlist.txt} -u [url]
```

Iterate over an wordlist to check if the subdomain is valid.
```
gobuster dns -w {wordlist.txt} -u [url]
```
### Dirhunt

[Dirhunt](https://github.com/Nekmo/dirhunt) web crawler for searching and analyzing directory within web application. It not an classic crawler instead of making request to the server. It will instead check other sources such as google, virus total to identify files and directories.

```
dirhunt example.tld
```

using the *-e* switch will allow you to look for specific files, that can give you access to forgotten files. 

```
dirhunt example.tld e zip,sh,z7
```

With some luck you might identify files like backups, config, and log files. 

If you want to be more specific you can use the *-f* switch

```
dirhunt example.com -f wp_admin,/etc/passwd
```

### Wfuzz

[wfuzz](https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz) is a web fuzzer that will brute-force website web application.
It very similar to dirhunt that we will be using an wordlist to try and identify directory, files, subdomains, etc. 
The way wfuzz works that is will replace any mention of FUZZ by the given payload. 
wfuzz comes with a wordlist called *big.txt* which can be used to identify a lot of files and directories. 


directory fuzzing
```
wfuzz -w worldlist.txt -hc 404 example.tld/FUZZ
```

Subdomain searching
```
wfuzz -w worldlist.txt -hc 404 FUZZ.example.tld/
```

Only your imagination is the limit to what wfuzz can do for you. e.g. fuzzing wordpress upload directory for hidden files.


### Photon

[Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon) is a web crawler and data extraction program designed for OSINT. 
It can easily to used to extract information from a website like names, emails documents, subdomains, API keys, etc. 

Another great feature of photon is their plugins what can gather information from third-party sites such as web archive like wayback machine.

The simplest web crawl 

```
python photon.py -u example.tdl
```

One identify using the *--clone** switch will take the sites and save a copy. 

```
python photon.py -u example.tdl --clone
```

Another feature of Photon is crawling DNS and subdomains using the *--dns* switch allowing you to capture the structure of the site and subdomain in one command.


```
python photon.py -u example.tdl --dns
```


This is all fine if you have a simple list, but if you get met with a larger sites, such as message boards. You might need to modify the scanning you can do that with the *-t* switch which will specific the amount of threads to use and *-d* to specify the depth of the search.

```
python photon.py -u example.tdl -t 5 -d 10
```

To scrape web archive from wayback machine you need to include the *-wayback* switch.

```
python photon.py -u example.tdl --wayback
```

### FinalRecon

[FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon) automatic web recon tool. Will quick analysis an website using multiple methods. The original goal of the tools was for penetration testing.


### Intrigue.io

[Intriguq-io](https://github.com/intrigueio/intrigue-core) -WIP-




## Documents

Documents are frequently hosted on websites. When you create an document with words and similar tools is will embed information about the user to the document metadata.  The metadata of these documents frequently not purged when uploaded to website. Allowing us to extract the information and identify information about the organization. Such as username, email, software, etc.

You an use search engines such as google to search for filetypes.
e.g. for searching for documents files
````
site:domain.tld filetype:pdf,xlsx,docx
````
This can be very extensive process of the large amount of files types and then they have to be downloaded and analyses for information.

### FOCA

[FOCA](https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA) is an Windows GUI tool used automate the process of finding additional domains and documents, extract and parse the metadata. The goal of FOCA is to identify as many document as possible using search engines. Once they have been identified they are downloaded and the metadata is extracted and the information analyzed.
The goal is to identify information about the organization like usernames, email, software, etc.
To get the most out of FOCA you need provide FOCA with Google and Bing API keys. Otherwise you will be hit will HTTP error code 429 to many request.


## Typosquatting

Registration of fake domains names that look similar to the target.

### dnstwist

[dnstwist](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist) tries to identify Typosquatting, phishing attack, brand impersonation, etc.

Display only the domain that are registered.
````python
dnstwist --registered domain.tld
````
