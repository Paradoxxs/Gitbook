# Cryptocurrency

## What is the blockchain

it works by having a public distributed ledger system, which everyone can read from, making every transaction transparent to everyone. To write to the ledger, you need to be in possession of a wallet private key. When you add a transaction to the ledger, it needs to verify, this is often done by the miners which are compute power that is rented out to the ledger and in exchange, the miner gets a fee for handling the verification process.

By joining as a node on the specific blockchain, which will allow you to pull down the ledger, to see all the transaction that have happend.

When you create an wallet you get an key pair an private and an public.\
The private key need to be protected, as it gives access to send money.\
The public key is the one you share with others as it allow people to send money to you.\
Hardware device can to used to contain the private key, in a secure way,\
e.g. [https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)

Exchanges are custodian of cryptocurrency, they allow one to buy and sell crypto.\
It also allow you to send currency within the exchange to other for a minimal fee, as everything is within the same ledger.\
Exchanges will group multiple transactions together into one block, making it hard to trace
