# IP address

Internet protocol (IP) purpose is to handle transmissions of packets between network end point, Host identify with a unique address. Using the OSI layer 3.

IP is a unique number that that reference to a computer.
IPv4 is a 32-bit limit to 4.294.967.296, because of this limit NAT have been developed to allowing more computers on the internet.
IPv6 is a 128-bit where the limit is 3.4 x 10â†‘34

When it comes to analysis IP addresses. I quickly go to [ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) because it can identify a lot of information. If you prefer to use cli they also have they option [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli).


## WhoIs

IP are registered like domains and using the **WhoIs** command will allow you to view the current WhoIs information.

[domainiq](https://www.domainiq.com/)

[ViewDNS](https://viewdns.info/whois/)

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

Does everything from identifying location, VPN, Service, domains and etc.

## Reverse domain names lookup
Multiple domain names can be hosted on a single IP address, using reverse dns lookup allow you to identify every domain hosted on the IP.

[View DNS Reverse IP](https://viewdns.info/reverseip/)

Bing search engine can also be used to identify domains hosted on a ip address. Using the query parameter **IP:{ip address}**.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)

Does a everything from identifying location, VPN, Service, domains and etc.

[bing.com/search?q=ip%3a+204.93.177.100](https://www.bing.com/search?q=ip%3a+204.93.177.100)

Will only identify one domain, if multiple domain are hosted on the same IP use the tools above. 

````cmd
nslookup {ip address}
````

## IP location
It possible to cross-locate an IP address.
Most often when searching for IP location it the providers location that is provided.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

[Geo-Recon tool](https://github.com/radioactivetobi/geo-recon)

[db-ip](https://db-ip.com/)

[iplocation](https://www.iplocation.net/)

[maxmind geoip](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data?lang=en)

Database over IP addresses geolocation.

## IP classification

Lookup up IP address that is involved in fraud and scams.

[Scamalytics](https://scamalytics.com/ip)

Will try to score IP address based on their risk.

[getipintel](https://getipintel.net/)

Using mathematical and computing techniques to identify is the IP is used as VPN or TOR node. Because the result is normalized it range is from 0 to 1. There 1 indicates it a VPN or TOR node.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) or [ipinfo cli](https://github.com/ipinfo/cli)

## Ports

Every service that is hosted on a IP address need it own port, one of the most common ports are HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443). There might be additional ports available.

[Censys](https://search.censys.io/)

Will allow you to search on IP addresses providing you with what ports are open on the individual ports.

[Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/)

Shodan is another option which scans the internet looking for open ports and try to fingerprint the service is running on the port. Can we used to look for camera connected to the internet, and many other things. I like to search on organization to identify what services they have running on the internet they might have forgotten
I recommend you buy the membership as it allow you to perform additional query and increase the API request you have. The normal price is $50 but it sometimes on sale for just $5.

## Torrenting

Identify what illegal material that have by download on a specific IP address.

[I know what you download](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/)


## TOR nodes

The onion router relay nodes used to hide people identify.

[Tor porject metrics](https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html)

Will tell you if an specific IP address was used as a TOR relay.

[ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/)
