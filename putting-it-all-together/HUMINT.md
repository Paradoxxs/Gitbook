This section is about interaction with the threat actor. 


As I learned throughout this process, threat actors can unknowingly
give away the greatest clues of their identity simply out of fear and
self‚Äêpreservation. Whatever your methods for communicating with
them, be sure to take what they say with a grain of salt and question
any information they present to you.
