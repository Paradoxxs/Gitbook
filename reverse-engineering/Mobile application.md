# Reverse mobile application

Mobile are becoming the most popular method of people to interact with the internet. 
 
Having the ability to reverse engineer mobile application is becoming an critical ability. Both for identifying if the application is malware or reverse engineering the application for forensics purpose to understand the context of information.


## Environment

Having you environment setup is an critical to perform both static and dynamic analysis of application. 

My tool of choice [MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) for both static and dynamic analysis. As of writing MobSF does not support dynamic analysis of IOS application.

To perform dynamic android application you need to emulate android. The one I will be using is [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/). It will handle the setup of android emulators.
