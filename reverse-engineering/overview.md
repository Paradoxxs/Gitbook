# Overview

The reason why we reverse engineer objective is to get better insight into the functionality of the software in question.\
This is done by dismantling the software into smaller pieces.\
Wether that is into a low level programming language like assembly. Or back to source code as with C#, Java, and etc. 


## Assembly

Assembly is a low level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instruction language and the architecture machine code instructions. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions.&#x20;
